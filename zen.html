        <h3>The Road ro Enlightment</h3>
        <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible <span class="sub"> DOMs</span>, broken <span class="sub">CSS</span> support, and abandoned browsers.</p>
        <p> We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the<span class="sub">W3C</span>, <span class="sub">WASP</span>, and the major browser creators.</p>
        
        <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.</p>

        <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
        <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of <span class="sub">CSS</span>. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very page. The <span class="sub"> HTML</span> remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external <span class="sub"> CSS</span> file. Yes, really. </p>
           
        <p><span class="sub"> CSS</span> allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.</p>

        <h3>Participation</h3>
        <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong <span class="sub"> CSS</span> skills are necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that even <span class="sub"> CSS</span> novices can use them as starting points. Please see the <a href="">CSS Resource Guide</a>  for advanced tutorials and tips on working with <span class="sub"> CSS</span>.</p>

        <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <span class="sub"> HTML</span>. This may seem daunting at first if you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.</p>
            
        <p>Download the sample <a href=""> HTML</a> and <a href="">CSS</a> to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your <span class="sub"> CSS</span> file to a web server under your control. <a href="">Send us a link</a> to an archive of that file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will download it and place it on our server.</p>
